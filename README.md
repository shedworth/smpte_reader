Manual backup of 2019 smpte timecode reader project

SMPTE timecode is widely used in the film, television and live events industries for synchronising playback machines, lighting consoles, special effects etc. An 80-bit word transmitted within the audible frequency range conveys a continuously-changing time reference in the form HH:MM:SS:FF across a balanced audio line utilising standard audio cabling, connectors and hardware. 

This reader and accompanying circuit ingests SMPTE timecode into Arduino and outputs the corresponding time reference on a 7-segment LED display.

The project makes use of existing open-source code.
